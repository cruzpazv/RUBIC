Description: RUBIC detects recurrent copy number aberrations using copy number
    breaks, rather than recurrently amplified or deleted regions. This allows for a
    vastly simplified approach as recursive peak splitting procedures and repeated
    re-estimation of the background model are avoided. Furthermore, the false
    discovery rate is controlled on the level of called regions, rather than at the
    probe level.
